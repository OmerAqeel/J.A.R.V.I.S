# J.A.R.V.I.S
My personal desktop assistant programmed to receive my commands and to obey them, gives me _reminders_ for the day. I sometimes use to open some of my application on my computer system. I have other functionalities in my mind for jarvis, which I will implement time to time.

## Libraries, modules, packages used:
1) **pyttsx3** - _used to convert the text to speach_
2) **speach_recognition** - _used to recognise speach with the support of several engines and APIs_
3) **datetime** - _used for getting the time and date_
4) **wikipedia** - _wikipedia module helps jarvis to get/read the information from wikipedia when asked_
5) **webbrowser** - _helps jarvis to open websites_
6) **os** - _enables jarvis to open applications_
