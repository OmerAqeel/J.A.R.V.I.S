# J.A.R.V.I.S
My personal desktop assistant programmed to receive my commands and to obey them, gives me _reminders_ for the day. I sometimes use to open some of my application on my computer system. I have other functionalities in my mind for jarvis, which I will implement time to time.

Let Jarvis introduce itself: 
>Hi, I am Jarvis. I am a personal Assistant of Mr Omer Aqeel. He has programmed me to receive his commands, complete his small tasks,give important information, remind him about his daily task that he has set for himself. I also manage his whatsapp messages, his emails etc. Mr Omer has other ideas in his mind for me, which I'm really excited for. Anyways it was nice meeting you,see you next time!
